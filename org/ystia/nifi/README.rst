**Nifi** is a technical component provided by YSTIA allowing data acquisition, simple event processing, transport and delivery mechanism designed to accommodate the diverse dataflows generated by connected systems (Databases, Sensors, Data Lakes, Data Platforms).

**Nifi** is used for data ingestion to pull data into NiFi, from numerous different data sources and create FlowFiles using a process group.
A Process Group is a specific set of processes and their connections, which can receive data via input ports and send data out via output ports. In this manner, process groups allow creation of entirely new components simply by composition of other components.

See https://nifi.apache.org/ for details.

- **Web Server** : hosts NiFiâ€™s HTTP-based command and control API.
- **Flow Controller** : the flow controller provides threads for extensions to run on, and manages the schedule of when extensions receive resources to execute.
- **Extensions** : there are various types of Nifi extensions that can be added.
- **FlowFile Repository** : the FlowFile Repository is where NiFi keeps track of the state of what it knows about a given FlowFile that is presently active in the flow.
- **Content Repository** : the Content Repository is where the actual content bytes of a given FlowFile live.
- **Provenance Repository** : The Provenance Repository is where all provenance event data is stored.
