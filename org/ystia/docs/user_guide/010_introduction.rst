Ystia CSAR library overview
===========================

**Ystia CSAR libray** provides a packaged solution to create easily Big Data application clusters on demand.
Deployment of Big Data applications can be done on a public Cloud (such as Amazon), or on a private cloud (such as OpenStack), on Bare-Metal or on HPC.

Big Data applications targeted by Ystia are:

- mainly **Hadoop** applications based on MapR_, Hortonworks_ or Cloudera_.
- and **Log Analysis** applications based on Elastic_ components.

In addition, Ystia CSAR libray provides useful components such as **SQL** and **Not Only SQL** database servers (MySQL_, MongoDB_, PostgreSQL_),
message brokers (Kafka_), a data science development environment (RStudio_)
and other technical components such as **Java**, **Consul** (Consensus Systems), allowing detailed application architectures to be designed.

The components are connected together in application topologies. To simplify topology creation, Ystia provides **topology templates** that can be extended by your applications.
